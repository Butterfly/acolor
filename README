acolor (Ada/ANSI color) is a simple Ada program that makes it easy to color
and format echoed text. It does this by converting combinations of readable
arguments (bold, red, green, underline, etc.) into an ANSI escape sequence
that your terminal emulator or console may understands.

It is Moshe Jacobson's color rewritten in Ada. I could not found his source
any more, and this ansi-color (http://code.google.com/p/ansi-color/) is done\
in bash script, a little bit slow on usage.

Why Ada? I think is a great language. Wrote in Ada give me a chance to
use it.

It is released under GPLv3. See the license file gpl-3.0.txt for detail.

Enjoy!
