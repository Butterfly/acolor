acolor: Ada/ANSI color
acolor:
acolor: acolor is a simple Ada program that makes it easy to color and format
acolor: output from shell script.  It does this by converting combinations of
acolor: readable arguments (bold, red, green, underline, etc.) into an ANSI
acolor: escape sequence that your terminal emulator or console may understands.
